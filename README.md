# Data Representation Project
Big project for data representation and querying 2020

Author: Miche√°l Cannon

The project builds a webpage for a school that enables teachers to create, update or delete student files in a database.

I first initialised a student database using initdb.sql. 
I then created server.py, StudentDao.py and index.html to allow users to update the student database. 
Next I initialised a registrations database and created RegistrationsDao.py and register.html to allow users to register on the site, thereby adding their details to the registrations database.
Finally I created a login page that attempted to authenticate login details by comparing against the registrations database.

Unfortunatey I ran out of time so the registration/login isnt as smooth as I hoped for.
